title: About me
---

I'm a last year graduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Technology of Troyes.

Passionate about Machine Learning, most specifically applied to machine perception and reasoning, I'm also very interested in hardware optimisation for deep learning algorithms. I'm currently very hyped by visual attention models, and generative models for multi-task learning.

Currently in research internship at Binghamton University, working on deep learning applied to steganalysis and steganograpy, under the supervision of Prof. Jessica Fridrich.

Looking for a research internship for February 2018, ideally would lead to a PhD position.
