title: About me
---

I'm a last year graduate student in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Technology of Troyes.

I'm passionate about Machine Learning, most specifically applied to machine perception and reasoning, I'm also very interested in hardware optimisation for deep learning algorithms.

I'm currently in research internship at Binghamton University, working on deep learning applied to steganalysis and steganograpy, under the supervision of Prof. Jessica Fridrich.
